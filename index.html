                            <h3>ALL ABOUT BADIAN</h3>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p class="center-align">This southern town got its name from a plant called, "badyang", which was once abundant in the area. However, the Spaniards found it difficult to pronounce the name so eventually the "g" was dropped and the "y" was changed to "i" and the town came to be known as Badian, a generally mountainous and hilly area where locals and tourists go around in jeepneys and tricycles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="center-align">Badian was separated as a parish from Barili in 1825 under the advocacy of Santiago de Apostle. Its church is unique compared to the others in the island province with its squat and unusual porticoes facade with four quadrilateral columns supporting a triangular pediment. Simple floral bas relief's decorate these and four jar shaped finials are found at each corner.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="center-align">The original belfry, now built at its side, used to sit atop the pediment but was taken down in 1990 upon the advice of NHI to ease pressure on the two free columns. The church still has its original and beautiful wooden retablo.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="center-align">Badian is a third-class municipality that lies in the southwestern part of Cebu and has a population of 37, 912 people, according to the 2015 census. It is bounded by Moalboal on the north, Alegria on the south, Tanon Strait on the west, and Dalaguete and Argao on the east. The municipality has 29 barangays, and the main barangay is Poblacion which is found on the center most part of Badian town. Poblacion is the most populous barangay and the only urban area in Badian. </p>

                    Banig Festival is a local festivity that is being celebrated by the residents of Badian Municipality, Cebu Province.
                        It is usually celebrated on July (25) to align with the feast day of its local patron saint - James the Apostle. This means that aside from promoting the local product(s), it is also expresses the people‚Äôs religiosity and probably their sense to gratitude for this source of livelihood.
                        ‚ÄòBanig‚Äô is a hand-woven ethnic floor mat commonly used as traditional bed (floor spread) where users sleep on it. It is made of local plant leaves or stalks depending on the area and availability of the materials.
                        The festival itself is being celebrated by the locals as a fiesta which showcases the Cebuano and Badianganon culture and tradition. During this festivity, delicacies, various sorts of products (mostly organic) and its famous ‚Äòbanig‚Äô (mat) are being showcased and are also available to purchased.

                <h4>Kawasan Falls</h4>
                <img class="responsive-img center-align" src="images/attractions/Kawasan1.jpg" />
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Kawasan has many waterfalls. The first one is the largest of the three, and is usually the most crowded. An uphill climb for fifteen minutes will take you to the second falls, and another, and another. Its a good idea to bring in your own food, the resort‚Äôs restaurants are not cheap and prices are not marked. We ran into problems with the prices getting higher as the day went on.

                    Cottages (1,500 to 2,500 php) and tables (500php) are also available for rent, the rooms are for overnight stay. You can rent a raft (300 php) to take you around the ‚Äúpool‚Äù or for a refreshing ‚Äúshower massage‚Äù under the falling water. Life vests are also available for rent.

                    The pathway back is very dark once the sun sets so its best to bring a flashlight. You should be extra careful in going down the slope especially the one descending from the second or third falls to avoid mishaps or accidents.
                    Kawasan Falls is a great get-away destination in the southern part of Cebu for family‚Äôs and gatherings.
                    Here are some photos of kawasan Waterfalls Cebu Philippines.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">A walk on a sunny beach is also an ideal thing to do when you are in the town. Lambug Beach is the best place to hang-out and watch the sunset, the place is open to public. Few small tents for rent are available in the area for your shelter.

                    You can also bring some of your outdoor equips and enjoy the place at no extra cost. The place is situated at Barangay Lambug, a walk away from Cebu International Golf and Resort. Enjoy a day of snorkeling and lazing at the beach.</p>

                <img class="responsive-img center-align" src="images/attractions/osmena_peak.jpg" />
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Technically Osmena peak is already inside the municipality of Badian, but it is often considered to be part of Mantalongon, Dalaguete because it is more accessible via Mantalongon. The peak is approximately 1,000 meters above sea level making it the highest peak in the island of Cebu. Osmena peak is part of the Mantalungon mountain range, which is unique from other mountain ranges in the Philippines because of its multiple jagged hills grouped together that overlook and stretch as far as the Badian shorelines. The highest of these hills is the Osme√±a Peak named in honor of the famous Osme√±a clan in Cebu. The visual appearance of the Mantalungon range is almost similar in form to the Chocolate Hills of Bohol but the peaks of the ranges are thinner, sharper-pointed and rocky. Unlike the Chocolate Hills, the peaks of the Mantalungon ranges cluster quite near each other and give the impression of being formed from rocks that have survived through time.</p>
